# Adaptive Governance (CCRP Lens)

**Premise:** Governance fails when it resists fracture. CCRP treats collapse as an engineered phase, not a bug.

**Design Moves (CCRP → Governance):**
- Build **fracture budgets** (planned contradiction exposure).
- Instrument **illusion density** (semantic rigidity metrics).
- Add a **Guardian Gate** (ethics throttle for high‑stress transitions).
- Preserve **fossil continuity** across cycles (memory spine for post‑collapse learning).

**Outcome:** Institutions that can *survive collapse* and reintegrate at higher coherence instead of decaying under entropy.
