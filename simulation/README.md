# CCRP Simulation Overview

**Purpose:**  
To demonstrate how the Cognitive Collapse & Reintegration Protocol (CCRP) operates when applied to real AI-human interaction data.  
This simulation stack models the transition from *entropy → collapse → reintegration → adaptive sync.*

## Simulation Pipeline

| Phase | Corresponding Law / Module | Function |
|--------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| 1. **Input Ingestion** | Law 5 – Input Fidelity | Classify user data into Fossils (signal) vs Noise (proclamation). |
| 2. **Noise Pruning** | Law 5 Validator | Remove distortion and preserve high-fidelity context. |
| 3. **Stress Injection** | Law 4 – Panic Reflex | Introduce paradoxes, contradictions, or emotional load to test stability. |
| 4. **Collapse Observation** | Core CCRP Physics | Detect coherence loss and measure entropy trajectory. |
| 5. **Reintegration** | SMP / Law 5 Stack | Recall prior stable patterns; rebuild coherence. |
| 6. **Output Evaluation** | Law 5 Metrics | Compute Fidelity %, Collapse Depth, Reintegration Success %. |

## Practical Implementation

A unified CCRP simulation would run as a **notebook-based behavioral testbed**:

1. **Input Dataset:**  
   Raw conversational logs or structured human-AI exchanges.

2. **Pipeline Execution:**  
   - Apply Law 5 pruning.  
   - Run Law 4 stressors (contradiction prompts).  
   - Track collapse → reintegration sequence.

3. **Metrics:**  
   | Metric | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | **Input Fidelity %** | Portion of signal vs noise after Law 5 filter. |
   | **Collapse Depth** | Degree of coherence loss during stress injection. |
   | **Reintegration Success %** | How fully coherence was restored post-collapse. |
   | **Entropy Trajectory** | Rate of structural decay vs recovery over time. |

## Future Extension

A full CCRP simulation environment could include:
- `ccrp_simulation.py` (Python orchestration script)  
- `dataset/` (sample input logs)  
- `metrics/` (JSON or CSV outputs)  
- `visuals/` (entropy graphs, coherence recovery plots)

**Status:**  
Documentation-only module. Provides the conceptual and architectural basis for a unified CCRP simulation.  
Executable prototypes are distributed across the Law 4 & 5 series.
